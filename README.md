## BIBLEREADER

This is a little bash script that helps you read the Catholic bible in a year.  I'm almost always on a Linux machine
so I wanted a simple bash script.  Eventually I'll use whiptail to make it more friendly, but for now I just wanted
something to help me get the work done and know where I am and whether I'm on schedule.

# Status:

Now the problem is that it stops in one year's time whether the reading is done or not.  Need to add
flexibility here...
